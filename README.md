# Silvasonic

**Autonomous Bioacoustic Recording Station for Raspberry Pi 5**

> **Status:** Initial Development / MVP

---

## What is Silvasonic?

Silvasonic is a professional-grade, containerized recording system designed for long-term bioacoustic monitoring in the field. The goal for **v1.0.0** is to transform a Raspberry Pi 5 into a resilient recording station capable of capturing the entire soundscape — from avian vocalizations to ultrasonic bat calls.

**Target Audience:** Researchers, conservationists, and bioacoustic enthusiasts requiring robust, unsupervised data collection.

For the long-term vision, design philosophy, and roadmap see **[VISION.md](VISION.md)**.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Linux (e.g., Debian or Fedora)
- **uv** installed
- **just** installed — command runner ([Installation](https://github.com/casey/just#installation))
- **Podman** & **podman-compose** installed

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyellsen/silvasonic.git
cd silvasonic
cp .env.example .env   # adjust settings as needed
just init               # create workspace directories & pull images
just build              # build all container images
just start              # start all services
```

## Current Services

The architecture is organized into **Tier 1** (Infrastructure, managed by Podman Compose) and **Tier 2** (Application, managed by Controller, **immutable**). Currently implemented:

| Service        | Tier | Role                                                                      | Status     |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **database**   | 1    | TimescaleDB / PostgreSQL — central state management                       | ✅ Running  |
| **controller** | 1    | Hardware/Container manager — health monitoring, placeholder orchestration | ✅ Scaffold |
| **recorder**   | 2    | Audio Capture — health monitoring, placeholder recording loop             | ✅ Scaffold |

> For the full target architecture (13 services across two tiers) see **[VISION.md](VISION.md)**.
