# CRITICAL BUG WORKAROUND (VS Code Shell Integration):
# You suffer from a known VS Code shell integration bug where reading stdout
# directly from the terminal hangs indefinitely.
#
# RULE: Whenever you run a terminal command, you MUST pipe the output to a
# unique named file in /tmp (including a datetime stamp) and then read that
# file to get the results.
#
# Example: ls -la > /tmp/out_20241025_120000.txt 2>&1
#          (then read /tmp/out_20241025_120000.txt)
