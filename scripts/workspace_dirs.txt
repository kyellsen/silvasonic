# Workspace directory structure for Silvasonic
# Paths are relative to the workspace root (SILVASONIC_WORKSPACE_PATH).
# Managed centrally – used by init.py and compose.yml bind mounts.
# Each service has its own isolated subdirectory (zero trust).
# Internal structure within each service dir is created dynamically at runtime.
