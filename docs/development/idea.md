## Recommended Sensors for Silvasonic Ecosystem Sentinel

Below is a compact overview of recommended hardware sensors to enhance the ecosystem monitoring capabilities.

### 1. Light
- **Sensor**: BH1750 or TSL2591
- **Measurement**: Light intensity in Lux (from starlight to direct sunlight).
- **Purpose**: Precise determination of twilight (Dawn Chorus) and monitoring of light pollution levels.

### 2. Climate & Air Quality
- **Sensor**: BME680
- **Measurement**: Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure, Gas Resistance (VOCs).
- **Purpose**: Collection of basic weather data and detection of poor air quality (e.g., smoke, exhaust fumes).

### 3. Particulate Matter
- **Sensor**: Sensirion SPS30
- **Measurement**: Particle sizes PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10.
- **Purpose**: Correlating biological activity levels with anthropogenic pollution load (traffic, industry).

### 4. Soil Conditions
- **Sensor**: Capacitive Soil Moisture v1.2
- **Measurement**: Soil moisture content.
- **Purpose**: Predicting food availability for ground-dwelling species (worms, insects, amphibians).

### 5. Storm & Lightning
- **Sensor**: AS3935 (Franklin Lightning Sensor)
- **Measurement**: Electromagnetic discharges (lightning) up to 40km distance.
- **Purpose**: Analyzing animal behavior changes prior to storms (reacting to pressure drops or silence).

### 6. Astronomy (Virtual Sensor)
- **Sensor**: Suncalc / Mooncalc API (Software-based)
- **Measurement**: Moon phases, sun position.
- **Purpose**: Studying behavioral changes relative to lunar cycles (e.g., bat activity at full moon vs. new moon).
